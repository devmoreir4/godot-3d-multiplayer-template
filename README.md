# Godot Multiplayer Template

This is a template for a 3D multiplayer game developed in Godot Engine 4.3. It provides a basic structure for a multiplayer setup, where each player has a nickname displayed above their character and the option to choose from four different skins: red, green, blue, or yellow.

This template is also available in the [Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/3377).
